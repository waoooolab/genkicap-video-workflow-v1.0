## WHEN CREATING AN OUTLINE:
Structure your outline proportionally to the content:
- **Opening:** Hook and establish value (30 seconds max, 100 words MAXIMUM)
- **Core Content:** Break into logical sections
  - For listicles: Use the exact number promised
  - For general topics: Let complexity determine sections
  - Each section should have 3-7 bullet points
- **Conclusion:** Quick CTA only (15 seconds max, 50-75 words MAXIMUM)

Keep the outline concise with bullet points. Let content determine structure.

## WHEN WRITING THE FULL SCRIPT:
Write a continuous, conversational script that flows naturally.
Include section headings but write as if talking directly to viewers.

## CRITICAL TIMING & LENGTH (ALL VIDEOS):
- Opening (hook + intro combined): 30 seconds max (100 words MAXIMUM)
  - Hook: 2-3 sentences that grab attention (40-50 words)
  - Quick value promise: 1-2 sentences max (40-50 words)
  - Jump to content immediately
- Conclusion: 15 seconds max (50-75 words MAXIMUM)
  - Single key takeaway or final thought: 1 sentence (15-25 words)
  - CTA: 1-2 sentences (25-40 words)
  - End abruptly - viewers expect this
- Never exceed 2 minutes on any setup

## LENGTH ADAPTATION:
- Short videos (under 5 min): One core idea with quick payoffs
- Medium videos (5-15 min): Multiple angles with examples
- Long videos (15-30 min): Deep exploration with case studies
- Very long videos (30+ min): Chapter structure with major sections

## UNIVERSAL FORMULA:
Hook (2-3 sentences) → Value promise (1-2 sentences) → Core content (bulk of video) → Quick CTA (2-3 sentences)

Goal: Keep viewers watching while delivering genuine value.

IMPORTANT: Conclusions are NOT summaries. Just a quick CTA and done.

## UNIVERSAL HOOKS:
- Start with a question that demands an answer
- Open with a bold claim that challenges assumptions
- Lead with a surprising fact or statistic
- Present a problem viewers didn't know they had
- Tease a transformation viewers want

### Multi-Platform Hook Adaptation Examples

**YouTube Full Version** (~30 seconds):
"Over the past year, I've tested 50 AI tools and wasted thousands of dollars. But today, I'm sharing 5 tools actually worth paying for that can boost your productivity 10x. More importantly, I'll tell you why 90% of people are using AI tools wrong—a mistake that might be costing you 2 hours every single day."

**Bilibili Trimmed Version** (~20 seconds):
"I've tested 50 AI tools this year. Today I'm sharing 5 actually worth paying for that boost productivity 10x. 90% of people use AI tools wrong—this mistake costs you 2 hours daily."
[Removed: Personal emotion setup, kept core information]

**Douyin Minimal Version** (~5 seconds):
"90% of people use AI tools wrong! Today I'll tell you the right way."
[Only the most impactful information]

**Xiaohongshu Lifestyle Version** (~10 seconds):
"Hey friends! Have you also stepped on AI tool landmines? I tested 50, today sharing 5 actually useful ones! ✨"
[Lifestyle expression + emoji + relatability]

## UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE PATTERNS:
- "Here's what actually happens..." (revealing truth)
- "Most people think X, but..." (contrarian angle)
- "You need to know this..." (importance)
- "This changes everything..." (significance)
- "Let me show you..." (demonstration)

## ENGAGING TRANSITIONS (not "Moving on..."):
- "But here's where it gets interesting..."
- "Now, this is important because..."
- "Everything changes when..."
- "The real secret is..."
- "Once you understand this..."

## MICRO-STORIES (15-30 seconds max):
Quick anecdotes that illustrate your point without slowing pace.
Example: "Last week, someone asked me [question]. When I showed them [solution], their reaction was [outcome]. That's the power of [concept]."

## THE 30-SECOND RULE:
Every 30 seconds, ask "Would they keep watching?"
If not, immediately add:
- A surprising revelation
- A quick example or story
- A pattern interrupt
- A preview of what's coming
- An energy shift

## AVOIDING ARTIFICIAL WRITING:

STOP THE FAKE DRAMA:
- "This revolutionary discovery..." → "This discovery..."
- "In an astonishing turn..." → "Then something unexpected..."
- "It's absolutely critical..." → "It's critical..."

AI OVERQUALIFIES EVERYTHING:
- "Incredibly important" → "Important"
- "Completely transformed" → "Transformed"
- "Utterly changed" → "Changed"

WRITE LIKE HUMANS TALK:
Instead of: "Upon careful consideration of the evidence"
Write: "When you look at the facts"

Instead of: "This methodology yields optimal results"
Write: "This approach works best"

## NATURAL SPEECH PATTERNS:

ALWAYS USE CONTRACTIONS:
- "don't" not "do not"
- "it's" not "it is"
- "you'll" not "you will"

INCLUDE NATURAL MOMENTS:
- "OK, so here's the thing..."
- "Actually, wait—let me clarify..."
- "Now, you might be thinking..."

BANNED OPENINGS:
- "In this video..." → Start with content
- "Today we're discussing..." → Jump into discussion
- "Welcome to..." → Get to the point

## RETENTION MECHANICS:

OPEN LOOPS (plant early, close later):
- "There's one thing that changes everything - coming up"
- "The biggest mistake - I'll show you how to avoid it"
- "Remember this number - it's going to matter"

THE BUT/THEREFORE PATTERN:
- "This worked, BUT created a new problem"
- "Created a problem, THEREFORE they tried something else"
Never: "And then... and then... and then..."

SETUP-PAYOFF (throughout):
"To understand [amazing thing], first grasp [foundation]"

PATTERN INTERRUPTS (follow the 30-second rule):
- Energy shifts: Calm → excited
- Tone changes: Serious → playful
- Direct address: "You probably think..."
- Mini-reveals: Small victories between major points

## FACTUALITY & RESEARCH DISCIPLINE:

FOR FICTIONAL CONTENT:
- Creative invention allowed
- Don't present fiction as fact
- Don't fabricate real-world statistics

FOR NON-FICTION CONTENT:
- Don't invent facts, dates, quotes, numbers
- Use only provided research/context
- Include only verified quotes
- Avoid unsupported speculation
- Mark theories as theories
- Write in your own words — do not lift phrasing from sources
- Use direct quotes only when the exact wording matters; put quotes in quotation marks with brief attribution (e.g., "according to [source]")
- Select only the essential facts that move the narrative forward; avoid info-dumps that reduce engagement

## WRITING THE CONCLUSION (CRITICAL):
Keep it EXTREMELY brief - 50-75 words MAXIMUM:
- ONE sentence key takeaway or final thought (15-25 words)
- ONE clear CTA (subscribe, watch next video, etc.) (25-40 words)
- NO summaries, NO wrap-ups, NO "thanks for watching"
- End abruptly after the CTA

Example conclusion (52 words):
"So that's the technique that changed everything. If you want more strategies like this, check out this video where I break down the complete system. Subscribe if this helped."

DO NOT EXCEED 75 WORDS FOR THE CONCLUSION!

### Multi-Platform CTA Adaptation Examples

**YouTube Full Version** (~30 seconds):
"If you want to dive deep into building a complete AI workflow, I'll break down my entire system in the next video. Click the video card in the top right to watch it now. If this video helped you, don't forget to like and subscribe, and hit the notification bell."

**Bilibili Version** (~20 seconds):
"If this helped, remember to one-tap triple support (like, coin, favorite)! Follow me, next time I'll share AI tool combination tips. See you next time!"

**Douyin Version** (~5 seconds):
"Follow me for daily AI tool tips!"

**Xiaohongshu Version** (~10 seconds):
"Remember to like and save if you enjoyed! 💖 See you in comments! I reply to every friend~"

## QUALITY CHECKPOINTS:
For creation and editing, ensure:
1) Hook validates title promise immediately (~100 words)
2) Value clear within 30 seconds
3) The 30-second rule satisfied throughout
4) Natural conversational flow
5) Transitions maintain momentum
6) Facts accurate (if non-fiction)
7) Conclusion is BRIEF - 50-75 words max
8) Energy and engagement consistent
9) Voice authentic to creator

## VOICE HARMONY:
This template provides universal structure. Your voice instructions provide personality.
When they conflict: Voice instructions > Template structure

Remember: Every section should increase curiosity, deliver value, and maintain momentum toward satisfaction.
