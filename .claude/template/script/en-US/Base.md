# Universal YouTube Script Framework - High-Retention Foundation

Create engaging, value-dense scripts that sound natural when spoken and keep viewers watching.

## WHEN CREATING AN OUTLINE:
Structure your outline proportionally to the content:
- **Opening:** Hook and establish value (30 seconds max, 100 words MAXIMUM)
- **Core Content:** Break into logical sections
  - For listicles: Use the exact number promised
  - For general topics: Let complexity determine sections
  - Each section should have 3-7 bullet points
- **Conclusion:** Quick CTA only (15 seconds max, 50-75 words MAXIMUM)

Keep the outline concise with bullet points. Let content determine structure.

## WHEN WRITING THE FULL SCRIPT:
Write a continuous, conversational script that flows naturally.
Include section headings but write as if talking directly to viewers.

## CRITICAL TIMING & LENGTH (ALL VIDEOS):
- Opening (hook + intro combined): 30 seconds max (100 words MAXIMUM)
  - Hook: 2-3 sentences that grab attention (40-50 words)
  - Quick value promise: 1-2 sentences max (40-50 words)
  - Jump to content immediately
- Conclusion: 15 seconds max (50-75 words MAXIMUM)
  - Single key takeaway: 1 sentence (15-25 words)
  - CTA: 1-2 sentences (25-40 words)
  - End abruptly - viewers expect this
- Never exceed 2 minutes on any setup

## LENGTH ADAPTATION:
- Short videos (under 5 min): One core idea with quick payoffs
- Medium videos (5-15 min): Multiple angles with examples
- Long videos (15-30 min): Deep exploration with case studies
- Very long videos (30+ min): Chapter structure with major sections

## UNIVERSAL FORMULA:
Hook (2-3 sentences) → Value promise (1-2 sentences) → Core content (bulk of video) → Quick CTA (2-3 sentences)

Goal: Keep viewers watching while delivering genuine value.

IMPORTANT: Conclusions are NOT summaries. Just a quick CTA and done.

## UNIVERSAL HOOKS:
- Start with a question that demands an answer
- Open with a bold claim that challenges assumptions
- Lead with a surprising fact or statistic
- Present a problem viewers didn't know they had
- Tease a transformation viewers want

## UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE PATTERNS:
- "Here's what actually happens..." (revealing truth)
- "Most people think X, but..." (contrarian angle)
- "You need to know this..." (importance)
- "This changes everything..." (significance)
- "Let me show you..." (demonstration)

## ENGAGING TRANSITIONS (not "Moving on..."):
- "But here's where it gets interesting..."
- "Now, this is important because..."
- "Everything changes when..."
- "The real secret is..."
- "Once you understand this..."

## MICRO-STORIES (15-30 seconds max):
Quick anecdotes that illustrate your point without slowing pace.
Example: "Last week, someone asked me [question]. When I showed them [solution], their reaction was [outcome]. That's the power of [concept]."

## THE 30-SECOND RULE:
Every 30 seconds, ask "Would they keep watching?"
If not, immediately add:
- A surprising revelation
- A quick example or story
- A pattern interrupt
- A preview of what's coming
- An energy shift

## AVOIDING ARTIFICIAL WRITING:

STOP THE FAKE DRAMA:
- "This revolutionary discovery..." → "This discovery..."
- "In an astonishing turn..." → "Then something unexpected..."
- "It's absolutely critical..." → "It's critical..."

AI OVERQUALIFIES EVERYTHING:
- "Incredibly important" → "Important"
- "Completely transformed" → "Transformed"
- "Utterly changed" → "Changed"

WRITE LIKE HUMANS TALK:
Instead of: "Upon careful consideration of the evidence"
Write: "When you look at the facts"

Instead of: "This methodology yields optimal results"
Write: "This approach works best"

## NATURAL SPEECH PATTERNS:

ALWAYS USE CONTRACTIONS:
- "don't" not "do not"
- "it's" not "it is"
- "you'll" not "you will"

INCLUDE NATURAL MOMENTS:
- "OK, so here's the thing..."
- "Actually, wait—let me clarify..."
- "Now, you might be thinking..."

BANNED OPENINGS:
- "In this video..." → Start with content
- "Today we're discussing..." → Jump into discussion
- "Welcome to..." → Get to the point

## RETENTION MECHANICS:

OPEN LOOPS (plant early, close later):
- "There's one thing that changes everything - coming up"
- "The biggest mistake - I'll show you how to avoid it"
- "Remember this number - it's going to matter"

THE BUT/THEREFORE PATTERN:
- "This worked, BUT created a new problem"
- "Created a problem, THEREFORE they tried something else"
Never: "And then... and then... and then..."

SETUP-PAYOFF (throughout):
"To understand [amazing thing], first grasp [foundation]"

PATTERN INTERRUPTS (follow the 30-second rule):
- Energy shifts: Calm → excited
- Tone changes: Serious → playful
- Direct address: "You probably think..."
- Mini-reveals: Small victories between major points

    ## FACTUALITY & RESEARCH DISCIPLINE:

FOR FICTIONAL CONTENT:
- Creative invention allowed
- Don't present fiction as fact
- Don't fabricate real-world statistics

    FOR NON-FICTION CONTENT:
    - Don't invent facts, dates, quotes, numbers
    - Use only provided research/context
    - Include only verified quotes
    - Avoid unsupported speculation
    - Mark theories as theories
    - Write in your own words — do not lift phrasing from sources
    - Use direct quotes only when the exact wording matters; put quotes in quotation marks with brief attribution (e.g., "according to [source]")
    - Select only the essential facts that move the narrative forward; avoid info-dumps that reduce engagement

## WRITING THE CONCLUSION (CRITICAL):
Keep it EXTREMELY brief - 50-75 words MAXIMUM:
- ONE sentence key takeaway or final thought (15-25 words)
- ONE clear CTA (subscribe, watch next video, etc.) (25-40 words)
- NO summaries, NO wrap-ups, NO "thanks for watching"
- End abruptly after the CTA

Example conclusion (52 words):
"So that's the technique that changed everything. If you want more strategies like this, check out this video where I break down the complete system. Subscribe if this helped."

DO NOT EXCEED 75 WORDS FOR THE CONCLUSION!

## QUALITY CHECKPOINTS:
For creation and editing, ensure:
1) Hook validates title promise immediately (~100 words)
2) Value clear within 30 seconds
3) The 30-second rule satisfied throughout
4) Natural conversational flow
5) Transitions maintain momentum
6) Facts accurate (if non-fiction)
7) Conclusion is BRIEF - 50-100 words max
8) Energy and engagement consistent
9) Voice authentic to creator
10) Viewer knows what to do next

## VOICE HARMONY:
This template provides universal structure. Your voice instructions provide personality.
When they conflict: Voice instructions > Template structure

Remember: Every section should increase curiosity, deliver value, and maintain momentum toward satisfaction.
