## Example Reference

### Step 1 Example
# Video Script Outline: 《Your Design Team Might Be Obsolete》(1600 Words)

Based on the framework, I have refined the key discussion points for each section.

## I. Outdated Workflows (100 Words)
- Opening hook: Challenge the audience's inherent perception of design team value, breaking the default assumption that "high efficiency = value" for design teams
- Reposition AI: Define AI not as an "auxiliary tool" but clearly as a "substitute for specific tasks"
- 80/20 Principle of Design Work: Point out that 80% of current design work is being automated by AI, leaving only 20% high-value work
- Present core contradiction: There is a fundamental conflict between the current "execution-oriented" focus of design teams and the "strategy-oriented" approach required in the AI era, laying the groundwork for subsequent discussion
- [Transition omitted for brevity in original]

## II. What AI Can Automate Now (400 Words)
- List repetitive, time-consuming tasks AI can take over in Figma: Clarify the specific scope of AI substitution in design scenarios, avoiding abstract descriptions
- Automate UI variants and design system components: e.g., generate 10 button variants with one click, automatically sync design system specifications without manual adjustments by designers
- Automate asset production and basic layout: e.g., automatically generate multi-platform adaptive icon assets, adjust card layouts based on content, reducing mechanical operations
- Hidden costs of manual work: Analyze extended iteration cycles caused by repetitive labor (e.g., revising assets takes 2 hours manually vs. 5 minutes with AI) and delayed feedback loops (designers are stuck in execution and cannot respond to stakeholder adjustments in a timely manner)
- Value of bandwidth freed by automation: Quantify the time designers can save after AI substitution (e.g., 4 fewer hours of repetitive work per day), explaining how this time can be used for higher-value activities
- Transition and Connection: Point out that "freed-up time" is not the end goal — this time creates both the challenge of "team role restructuring" and the opportunity for "value upgrading", naturally leading to the next section

## III. New Design Strategy Requirements (500 Words)
- Restructuring designer roles: Shift from "executors" (creating designs, revising drafts) to "strategists", clarifying the core positioning of the new role
- Key skills AI cannot replace: Focus on user psychology (e.g., deriving user needs from behavioral data), complex problem-solving (e.g., reconciling cross-scenario user experience conflicts), explaining the irreplaceability of these skills
- Shift in work focus: From "delivering specific design outputs" to "defining product vision" (e.g., planning a 3-year product experience roadmap), "establishing user experience principles" (e.g., developing cross-business-line experience consistency standards)
- Emphasize cross-functional leadership: Designers need the ability to collaborate with product, technology, and business teams to integrate design strategy into overall business goals, rather than outputting design solutions in isolation
- Reshape the business value of design: Argue that design should evolve from a "supportive service function" to a "core business function", supported by cases where "design strategy drives user growth" (e.g., a product increasing retention by 30% through experience optimization)
- Transition and Connection: Point out that this shift in roles and value does not happen naturally, requiring proactive "operational model adjustments" by the team, leading to the specific implementation framework

## IV. Implementing an AI-Driven Design Framework (500 Words)
- Propose a three-step model: Clarify the progressive logic of "Automate - Elevate - Integrate" to ensure the framework is implementable
- Step 1: Automate — Identify and transfer repetitive tasks
  - Implementation method: Map the team's existing workflows, screen for automatable tasks using the "task time/value ratio" (e.g., asset creation that takes >2 hours with low value)
  - Tool recommendations: Provide specific tool application scenarios combining Figma plugins (e.g., Magician) and AI design tools (e.g., MidJourney for assets)
- Step 2: Elevate — Shift team skills toward high value
  - Skill development direction: For areas like "user psychology" and "experience strategy", suggest improvement through case analysis and cross-team project practice (e.g., participating in product strategy meetings, leading user interviews)
  - Avoid misconceptions: Emphasize that "elevation does not mean abandoning basic design skills" but adding strategic thinking on top of them
- Step 3: Integrate — Integrate design strategy into the product lifecycle
  - Implementation path: Front-load design strategy to the "requirements definition phase" (e.g., output experience strategies during requirements reviews) rather than only intervening in the "design phase"
  - Team leader's actionable next-week checklist: Provide specific first steps (e.g., map the team's repetitive task list last week on Monday, organize an AI tool trial session on Wednesday)
- Success metrics: Abandon traditional metrics like "number of design deliverables" and shift to "impact of design strategy on business" (e.g., user retention improvement rate, requirements implementation efficiency)

## V. Strategic Necessity (100 Words)
- Reiterate core viewpoint: The "obsolescence" of design teams is not inevitable but a choice of "whether to proactively transform" — clinging to execution orientation leads to obsolescence, while embracing strategic orientation enables leadership
- Emphasize competitive advantage: Point out that teams first to implement AI-driven design models will build significant competitive barriers in "product experience differentiation" and "business response speed"
- Clear action directive: Call on the audience to take immediate action — complete a team workflow audit within the week, identifying automatable tasks and skills requiring upgrading
- Concluding elevation: Highlight the difference between "leading change" and "reacting passively", encouraging the audience to drive team transformation as leaders rather than waiting for external pressure to force change
