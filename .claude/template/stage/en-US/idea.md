## Template Structure
# Video Content Planning for [Topic Theme/Domain]

[Opening Description: Briefly explain the topic background and positioning strategy]

Currently, [topic domain/theme] is [market positioning description]. To make this video stand out in the channel with "[channel positioning description]", we need to focus on **[core differentiation strategy]** rather than [directions to avoid].

## I. Reference to Competitor Channels
Existing channels (e.g., [Channel A], [Channel B]) focus on "[competitor direction]", while your video should target [target audience] and highlight **[core value proposition]**.

- **[Channel Name 1]**
  - [Subscriber Count] / [Video Count]
  - Content Direction: [direction description]

- **[Channel Name 2]**
  - [Subscriber Count] / [Video Count]
  - Content Direction: [direction description]

## II. 3 Core Angles Aligned with "[Channel Style/Audience Characteristics]"
| Angle No. | Angle Name | Core Focus | Audience's Target Takeaway |
|-----------|------------|------------|----------------------------|
| 1         | [Angle Name] | [core content and focus of this angle] | [specific value the audience can gain] |
| 2         | [Angle Name] | [core content and focus of this angle] | [specific value the audience can gain] |
| 3         | [Angle Name] | [core content and focus of this angle] | [specific value the audience can gain] |

## III. Title Suggestions (Maximize Click-Through Rate: Highlight Conflict + Duality)
- **《[Title 1]》** (Based on Angle 1)
- **《[Title 2]》** (Based on Angle 2)
- **《[Title 3]》** (Based on Angle 3)

## IV. Next Step Confirmation
Please select the appropriate angle and title, and inform us of the target text script length for the video (e.g., a 10-minute video typically corresponds to approximately 1600 words of script), so we can further create specific content.

Would you like me to supplement the corresponding **core script framework** for your selected angle?

## Example Reference
# Video Content Planning for AI Integration with Figma

Currently, the integration of AI with design tools like Figma is a high-demand niche area. To make this video stand out in the channel "for tech professionals, focusing on data/innovation/business success", we need to focus on **strategic value** rather than the features themselves.

## I. Reference to Competitor Channels
Existing channels (e.g., Figma, Dive Club) focus on "operational tutorials" and "design itself", while your video should target data-driven leaders and highlight **ROI and process optimization**.

- **Figma Channel**
  - 714K subscribers / 1462 videos
  - Content Direction: Operational teaching for Figma design tools

- **Dive Club Channel**
  - 55.6K subscribers / 343 videos
  - Content Direction: Application skills of AI design tools

## II. 3 Core Angles Aligned with "Data-Driven Innovators" Style
| Angle No. | Angle Name | Core Focus | Audience's Target Takeaway |
|-----------|------------|------------|----------------------------|
| 1         | ROI of AI Design | Quantify the commercial value of integrating AI tools into Figma workflows (e.g., measurable outcomes like shortened design iteration time, accelerated product launch speed) | Clearly prove the investment rationality of introducing AI design tools to management and provide decision-making basis |
| 2         | Skill Obsolescence Warning | Analyze that AI is replacing low-value design work (e.g., basic typesetting, repetitive revisions), and how product leaders can help teams upgrade core skills (forward-looking/challenging perspective) | Understand the transformation urgency of design teams under AI popularization, and master the direction and methods of team skill upgrading |
| 3         | Automated Process Framework | Provide a step-by-step implementable framework: directly integrate 3-5 specific AI tools (e.g., Figma AI plugins, MidJourney, etc.) into the existing Figma/product development lifecycle | Obtain immediately executable practical solutions, quickly build AI+Figma workflows, and improve team efficiency |

## III. Title Suggestions (Maximize Click-Through Rate: Highlight Conflict + Duality)
- **《AI in Figma Is Your Newest Competitive Advantage》** (Based on Angle 1)
- **《Your Design Team Might Already Be Obsolete》** (Based on Angle 2)
- **《Build a Figma AI Workflow in 1 Hour - This Step Saves 30% Time》** (Based on Angle 3)

## IV. Next Step Confirmation
Please select the appropriate angle and title, and inform us of the target text script length for the video (e.g., a 10-minute video typically corresponds to approximately 1600 words of script), so we can further create specific content.

Would you like me to supplement the corresponding **core script framework** for your selected angle?
