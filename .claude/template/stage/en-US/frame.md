## Template Structure

### Step 1: Generate Framework (Awaiting User Confirmation)
# Video Content: Script Planning from the "[Angle Name]" Perspective

[Opening Description: Briefly respond to the user's selected angle and explain its suitability]

This title is [evaluation]. The "[Angle Name]" perspective is ideal for [target audience characteristics].

This video should not focus excessively on [content to avoid], but instead center on **[core focus point]**.

## Core Concept: [Core Concept Name]
This video will argue that: [description of core argument]. **[key shift/perspective]**.

The core shift is: moving from "[old model]" to "[new model]".

## Recommended Structure ([Structure Type] Template)
Using the [Structure Type] template of the "[Structure Name]" framework is well-suited for this topic:

**Target Duration**: [X] minutes
**Target Word Count**: [XXXX] words (calculated at approx. 160 words per minute)

| Section | Core Focus | Estimated Word Count | Estimated Duration |
|---------|------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Hook    | [opening strategy and core viewpoint] | [X] words | approx. [X] sec |
| Section 1: [Section Name] | [core content of this section] | [X] words | approx. [X] min [X] sec |
| Section 2: [Section Name] | [core content of this section] | [X] words | approx. [X] min [X] sec |
| Section 3: [Section Name] | [core content of this section] | [X] words | approx. [X] min [X] sec |
| Conclusion/Call to Action | [closing strategy and CTA] | [X] words | approx. [X] min [X] sec |
| **Total** |            | **[Total Words]** | **[Total Duration]** |

Do you find this structure and estimated duration appropriate? Shall we proceed to script creation?

### Step 2: Next Steps Confirmation
# Framework Confirmation Completed: 《[Video Title]》

[Description based on actual user confirmation/selection, e.g.: "Great, this direction aligns perfectly..."、"Understood, we'll proceed with this framework..." etc.]

**Selected Angle**: [Angle Name]
**Core Concept**: [Core Concept] (shifting from "[old model]" to "[new model]")
**Structure Template**: [Structure Name] ([Structure Type])
**Target Duration**: [X] minutes
**Target Word Count**: [XXXX] words (calculated at approx. 160 words per minute)

## Next Steps
You can choose:
1. **Proceed to Outline Confirmation** → Refine content points for each section
2. **Start Script Writing Directly** → Skip outline and write script immediately
3. **Supplement Background Information** → Add more context to optimize the framework
4. **Adjust Framework** → Regenerate or fine-tune the current framework

## Example Reference
### Step 1 Example
# Video Content: Script Planning from the "Skill Obsolescence Warning" Perspective

This title is impactful and provocative. The "Skill Obsolescence Warning" perspective is perfect for capturing the attention of tech leaders who need to keep up with trends.

This video should not focus excessively on how to use tools, but instead center on **the strategic necessity of transforming team operating models**.

## Core Concept: Strategic Necessity
This video will argue that: Traditional design workflows (where designers spend most of their time on repetitive tasks such as creating variants, organizing files, and generating simple assets) are now obsolete. **It's not that teams are obsolete, but their tasks are**.

The core shift is: moving from "design execution" to "design strategy".

## Recommended Structure (Educational/Explanatory Template)
Using the explanatory template of the "WHY-WHAT-HOW" framework is well-suited for this topic:

**Target Duration**: 10 minutes
**Target Word Count**: 1600 words (calculated at approx. 160 words per minute)

| Section | Core Focus | Estimated Word Count | Estimated Duration |
|---------|------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Hook    | Bold assertion: The old design process is dead. Introduce the core viewpoint that AI is driving strategic transformation. | 150 words | approx. 56 sec |
| Problem: 80% Obsolete Work | Detail the 80% of existing design work that AI can automate (e.g., generating 100 variants, organizing file structures, basic image masking), and demonstrate the costs of this ineffective work. | 350 words | approx. 2 min 12 sec |
| Solution: The Critical 20% Work | Define the new high-value 20% work: user psychology analysis, complex interaction design, defining product future vision, strategic alignment. | 400 words | approx. 2 min 30 sec |
| Framework: AI-Driven Design Teams | Introduce a simple, implementable transformation framework: 1. Automate 2. Elevate 3. Integrate. Explain each step with data-driven reasoning. | 500 words | approx. 3 min 7 sec |
| Conclusion/Call to Action | Reiterate strategic urgency. Call on the audience to implement the final action directive of this framework. | 200 words | approx. 1 min 15 sec |
| **Total** |            | **1600 words** | **10 minutes** |

Do you find this structure and estimated duration appropriate? Shall we proceed to script creation?

### Step 2 Example
# Framework Confirmation Completed: 《Your Design Team Might Be Obsolete》

Great, this direction aligns perfectly with your needs.

**Selected Angle**: Skill Obsolescence Warning
**Core Concept**: Strategic Necessity (shifting from "design execution" to "design strategy")
**Structure Template**: WHY-WHAT-HOW (Educational/Explanatory)
**Target Duration**: 10 minutes
**Target Word Count**: 1600 words (calculated at approx. 160 words per minute)

## Next Steps
You can choose:
1. **Proceed to Outline Confirmation** → Refine content points for each section
2. **Start Script Writing Directly** → Skip outline and write script immediately
3. **Supplement Background Information** → Add more context to optimize the framework
4. **Adjust Framework** → Regenerate or fine-tune the current framework

## Usage Instructions
### Output Timing
- Based on the user-selected angle in `stages/idea.md`
- After confirming the target video duration
- After analyzing the core concept and argumentation direction
- After selecting the appropriate video structure template

### Mandatory Elements
#### Step 1 Output:
- ✅ Recap of selected angle (topic name, core concept)
- ✅ Target video duration and corresponding word count (e.g., 10-minute video ≈ 1500-1800 words)
- ✅ Explanation of video structure template (structure type, rationale for selection)
- ✅ Segmented framework table (section, core focus, estimated word count, estimated duration)
- ✅ Closing confirmation question

#### Step 2 Output:
- ✅ Summary of key information (angle, concept, structure, duration, word count)
- ✅ Next step options

### Key Rules
#### Duration Display Rules:
- Use seconds for < 60 seconds (e.g., "30 sec")
- Use minutes for ≥ 60 seconds (e.g., "1.5 minutes")

#### Word Count Conversion:
- Reference: 1 minute ≈ 150-180 words
- Adjust based on content type (more for educational content, fewer for storytelling)

### Platform Adaptation Notes
⚠️ **Multi-platform adaptation is not handled in this template**

This template only generates frameworks for a **single target platform**. Multi-platform adaptation (YouTube/Bilibili/Douyin/Xiaohongshu) is handled through the "Platform Intelligent Adaptation Mechanism" in Phase 5 (Script Writing) of CLAUDE.md.

### File Management
- Current Version: `stages/frame.md`
- Historical Versions: `_archive/frame_v01.md`, `_archive/frame_v02.md`
- When users request modifications/regeneration, move old versions to the `_archive/` directory

### User Feedback Handling
- Confirm framework → Proceed to Step 2 "Next Steps Confirmation"
- Request framework modifications → Return to Step 1 to regenerate
- Request additional explanations → Provide verbal/written clarification
