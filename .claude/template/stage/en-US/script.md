## I. Outdated Workflows
Did you know? 80% of the work most design teams do today may be worthless in the AI era.

I'm not talking about AI "assisting" designers—AI is directly replacing repetitive design execution tasks: generating 100 button variants, adjusting responsive layouts, and batch-exporting assets. Tasks that once took designers hours can now be completed by AI in minutes.

But the core issue isn't the change in tools; it's the misalignment of design teams' value positioning. If your team still focuses on "execution-oriented" work—competing on who can create designs faster or revise drafts more—it might truly be obsolete. Because the AI era demands "strategy-oriented" design teams.

---
## II. What AI Can Automate Now
Let me break down exactly which design tasks AI can take over today.

First: UI variants and design system components. Previously, creating 10 button variants (different sizes, states, and themes) manually could take half a day. Now, AI plugins can generate them with one click and automatically sync to design system specifications. Designers no longer need to spend time on such mechanical adjustments.

Second: Asset production and basic layout. For example, adapting icon assets for multiple platforms or automatically adjusting card layouts based on content. These tasks take AI minutes to complete, while manual work could take hours.

What are the hidden costs of this repetitive labor? Extended iteration cycles (revising assets takes 2 hours manually vs. 5 minutes with AI) and delayed feedback loops (designers get stuck in execution and can't respond quickly to stakeholder adjustments).

After AI replaces these tasks, designers can save 4 hours per day. What can they do with this time? User research, experience strategy, product vision planning—these are truly high-value tasks.

However, freeing up time doesn't solve the problem. This freed-up time creates both the challenge of "team role restructuring" and the opportunity for "value upgrading." How can designers shift from "executors" to "strategists"? That's what we'll discuss next.

## Usage Instructions
### Output Timing
- Export the confirmed version of `stages/draft.md` to `script.md` (final version in project root directory)
- After the user confirms satisfaction and selects "Export Final Script"

### Mandatory Elements
- ✅ Complete video script content (copied from draft.md)
- ✅ Script metadata (title, duration, word count, date)
- ✅ Script statistics table (word count and duration for each section)
- ✅ Creation journey record (optional but recommended)

### Key Rules
#### Content Source
- Directly copy the confirmed script content from `stages/draft.md`
- Maintain consistent formatting to ensure complete content

#### Metadata
- Extract title, duration, and word count from draft.md
- Use the current date for creation date

#### Creation Journey
- Record key decisions from Phase 1 to Phase 6
- Facilitate future review and reference

### File Management
- Final Version: `script.md` (project root directory)
- No further updates to this file (unless requested by the user)
- If modifications are needed, return to the corresponding phase for reprocessing

### Project Status Marking
- After exporting `script.md`, mark the project status as "Script Completed"
- The user can initiate the video production process
